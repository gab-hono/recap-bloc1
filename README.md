# 🎨 My Skills Portfolio - Full Stack Project

Hi again! It's me, after my first 4 months of learning full stack development :)

For this project, I assembled back and front together, not using any library yet but constructing a site which allows to:

-  **Display my technical skills** organized by themes (Frontend, Backend, Frameworks, Spoken Languages)
-  **Visualize my progress level** for each skill with animated progress bars
-  **Add new skills dynamically** through a form that connects to a PostgreSQL database
-  **Update and delete skills** via RESTful API endpoints (still need to update the functionalities on the fronend)
-  **Store everything persistently** in a cloud database (Neon)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

For this project, I used:

### **Frontend**
- **HTML5** - Structure and semantic markup
- **CSS3** - Styling with custom animations and responsive design
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - DOM manipulation, fetch API for backend communication, and form handling (no libraries!)

### **Backend**
- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime environment
- **Express.js** - Web server and API routing
- **PostgreSQL** - Relational database for storing themes and skills
- **Neon** - Serverless PostgreSQL hosting platform
- **@neondatabase/serverless** - Neon's database driver for connecting to PostgreSQL
